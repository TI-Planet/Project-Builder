# TI-Planet's Project Builder

A set of online tools used on TI-Planet to explore programming on TI calculators.

The repo doesn't yet have all of the files yet - some are still being code-reviewed and will be committed ASAP :)

Note that you'll need PHP 7.1+ to run it. Technically, so far almost all of the code is compatible with PHP 5.6, but some parts are gradually using newer features.
